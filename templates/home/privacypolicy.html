        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            As the website name would suggest, Anondex supports complete <em>anonymity</em>.
            This means that your identity should be able to remain unknown if you wish.
            For this reason, Anondex provides nearly all services without any type of user registration.
        </p>
        <p>The following privacy policy applies to registered and anonymous users alike:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will never reveal your IP address.</li>
            <li>If an email address is provided, we only show it publicly if you set it to visible. And even when it is shown, we do out best to prevent spambot or search engine recognition. (?)</li>
            <li>Your information is not intentionally sent to any third party besides <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" class="no-ajaxy">Google</a> for user analysis.</li>
            <li>When authenticating through third-party service such as Facebook, Google, OpenID, etc, we will not reveal your connection to that service without your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The above policy will only be guaranteed while the <a href="{% url home_tos %}">Terms of Service</a> are followed.
            This means that some grave violations of the Terms of Service could result in forfeiting your privacy. <a class="no-ajaxy" href="/?warned">You've been warned!</a>
        </p>
